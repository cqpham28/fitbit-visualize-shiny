## 1. Introduction
- This study employs a Python-based Shiny application that integrates Fitbit data visualization through a user-authenticated dashboard. Highlight features:
    - Integrates Fitbit data from Firebase.
    - Renders multiple interactive visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib in a grid layout.
    - Enables user-specific data exploration (e.g., by day selection).

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. System Setup
- **API**: The project utilizes the official *Fitbit Web API* to access the userâ€™s wearable data. Data endpoints include activity metrics, heart rate, steps, etc. 
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Access to the Fitbit data API is secured via *OAuth 2.0* authorization protocol. The system handles token management, including obtaining initial access tokens via manual process, ensure user privacy and data security.
- **Data Storage and Management**: Collected personal Fitbit data, then stored securely on *Google Firebase*, where it will be organized and indexed to support efficient querying

### 2.2 Data Visualization
- Some plots includes:
    - Line plots: Created using Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize time-series data for steps and heart rates.
    - Gauge plots: Plotly indicators represent total daily steps or distances compared to goals (e.g., 10K steps or 8.05 km).
    - Bar plots: Visualize categorical distributions such as active minutes and distances by zone.
    - Histograms: Show heart rate distribution for the selected day

- Key visualization metrics:

| 7   | Total Distances            | Daily summary            | Gauge plot           |
| 8   | Time - Active Zones        | Active minutes summary   | Bar chart            |
| 9   | Distance - Active Zones    | Activity distances       | Bar chart            |


## 3. Experiment
- **Duration & Period:** The data collection experiment was conducted over a two-week period from **May 15th to May 31st, 2025**.
- **Participants:** This initial pilot involved 1 user (me) who actively wore the Fitbit device during daytime hours.
